# Speed Project

This was my final project with Bloc. I had 24 hours to "Design and build a single-page website for a new movie coming to a theater near you."  This project was meant to emulate a take-home assignment for a job interview.

## Design Process

### User Surveys

While I only had a short timeframe, during which I still needed to work my normal hours, it was important to me to create a design in line with what users want. I couldn't know this without doing some user research. Therefore, I started by deploying [this survey](https://forms.gle/ho9E5WS91aQFVT8i7) to get an idea of what kinds of features my website should include.


### Competitive Analysis
After deploying my survey on Slack for Bloc students and on my own social media, I left it open for a couple hours. I used this time to check out what competitors' sites looked like. You can see the different screens I looked at [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1raw5CCl-2ZZ0JvSlBs0odOqBT_o5O8Y3sd-JeM3oq_E/edit?usp=sharing).


### Wireframing
Once I had a couple dozen responses to my survey, I analyzed the features, I broke down the features users into the following categories, based on number of votes: Need, Probably, Maybe, and Don't Need.

I used Adobe XD to quickly iterate on wireframes.  You can see my wireframes [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/297baf6b-a98c-4a51-62fe-bb574508de6d-5f4a/). There, you'll also see my list of features organized into categories (on page 6).

Due to time constraints, I didn't want to spend time on hi-fi mockups. My main task was to incorporate user research into a fully developed web page. If I spent too long on visual design, I worried I wouldn't be able to give enough time to my code.

### Frontend Development
While there is no doubt that [my web page](https://thisisnataliessn.github.io/movie-site/) could could be more visually appealing, I am proud at how much I was able to complete in just a few hours:
* Appropriate information hierarchy
* Fully responsive
* Gradients over photos, allowing for white text to be legible
* Information my research showed users WANT to see, including items you need to dig/click for on other existing movie sites (Bechdel test, People of color, movies actors/directors are known for)
